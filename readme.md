# gremlin

A collection of utilities to make writing a model more concerned with semantics and come together intuitively, rather than getting bogged down in too many implementation details.

This includes features like:

- Data structures for working with timeseries.
- Units leveraging the type system so that the expected units are self-documented throughout the model and checked at compile-time.
- Helpers for processing raw data into consistent types.
- Helpers for automating some aspects of model documentation.
- Helpers for capturing model outputs.
